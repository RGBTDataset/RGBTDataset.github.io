<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Dataset Description</h4>

<p>We record video pairs under sixteen different scene types,such as laboratory room, campus road, play ground and water pool, and detailedly analyze the diversity and bias of the constructed dataset in following aspects:</p>

<p><font color="black" >Object category</font> The objects in our RGBT dataset are divided into two categories: rigid and non-rigid objects. Rigid objects, including vehicles and human heads, usually move fast and have large scale variation over time. Nonrigid objects, including humans and swans, have very high degree of freedom, and usually increases the difficulty in tracking.</p>
<p><font color="black"  >Object size</font> Small objects frequently appear in visual surveillance. Tracking of small objects is essential yet challenging. They usually are less color or structure information, and easier to lead to model drift.</p>
<p><font color="black" >Illumination condition</font> The video sequences are recorded under different weather conditions, including sunshine, overcast sky, rainy and snow, which can bring big challenges in RGB videos. In addition, the illumination of some RGB videos significantly varies over time.</p>
<p><font color="black" >Thermal Crossover </font> When the targets have similar temperature with other objects or background, “thermal crossover” will occur in thermal videos. In such circumstance, thermal information will be ambiguous in tracking objects.</p>
<p><font color="black" >Scale variation</font> Scale adaptation is important to alleviate model drift. Some of our videos have large scale variation, e.g., the car is driven from far to near. We present the histogram of relative area to the first frame bounding box in Fig. 1 (d) to reflect the statistics of scale variation.</p>
<p><font color="black" >Presence of occlusion</font> Our videos cover several aspects of occlusion, e.g., how much the target is occluded, how long the target is occluded, and the target is completely occluded in RGB (thermal) video while can be seen in thermal (RGB) video.</p>
<p><font color="black" >Moving speed</font> We also take the motion speed of the target into account. Fig. 1 (e) shows the histogram of center distance between consecutive frames, which can reflect the statistics of moving speed.</p>

<p>According to above analysis, we summarize eight attributes to construct the subsets of whole dataset for facilitating evaluation of trackers on different challenging factors, as shown in Tab. 1. We also present the attribute distribution in Fig. 1 (c). Aside from presenting the performance on the whole dataset, we further analyze the attribute-based performance for better understanding the trackers under specific challenging conditions. </p>
